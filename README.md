# charmCam
An attempt for a linux version of beauty/AR filters similair to the discontinued snapCamera for windows/macOS 
mainly iterested in light beautification filters, why should linux users not look their best on video calls?

current goals:

1) face detection for live video feed (must be able to handle natural head movement and be fast)
looking at mediapipe

2)figure out how to input the video feed from webcam device and not use video file

3)AR beautification filters, machine learning problem... looking for minimal beautification 

4)put it all together, how to get filter output as webcam feed for video applications (zoom, skype, etc.)

5)make it pretty

6)Easy way to make and apply new filters
